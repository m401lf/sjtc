Feature: Verification of Registration functionality
  As a customer
  I want to be able to register my account
  So that I can start shopping


  Background: common steps among scenarios
    Given I landed on Ecommerce website
    When I tap on "Login or register" to navigate to login page
    And I can see current page breadcrumb "Login"
    And I can see "I AM A NEW CUSTOMER." and "RETURNING CUSTOMER"
    And I can see "Register Account" is checked by default
    And I click on continue button
    And I can see page title "Create Account" and page header "CREATE ACCOUNT"
    And I can see current page breadcrumb "Register"
    And I should see "If you already have an account with us, please login at the login page."

      | Your Address          |
      | Login Details         |
