    And I login in login page as a returning customer with unique email and password "<password>"

    Then should be presented with the following Error validation message as "<loginValidationErrorMessage>"
    And back to login page title as "Account Login"
    #And I should be offered with the option "Forgotten Password"

    Examples:
      | password | loginValidationErrorMessage                           |
